This document provides a comprehensive overview of all 20 visualizations created during the translation model performance analysis.

## Cost-Focused Visualizations (Priority)

### 1. Average Translation Cost by Model
**File**: `01_cost_by_model.png`
**Description**: Bar chart showing mean cost per translation for each model with error bars indicating variability. Nova Lite is the most expensive, while Claude 3.5 Haiku and Meta Llama are most cost-effective.

### 2. Cost vs Quality Trade-off Analysis
**File**: `02_cost_vs_quality_scatter.png`
**Description**: Scatter plot revealing the relationship between translation cost and quality (BLEU F1 score). The trend line shows whether higher cost correlates with better quality across all models.

### 3. Cost Breakdown - Input vs Output Token Costs
**File**: `03_cost_breakdown.png`
**Description**: Stacked bar chart breaking down total cost into input and output token components for each model. Output tokens typically cost more than input tokens, varying significantly by model.

### 10. ROI Analysis - Cost vs Composite Performance
**File**: `10_roi_analysis.png`
**Description**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between cost and overall performance. Points in the upper-left represent the best value (high performance, low cost). The composite score combines all quality metrics with weighted importance.

### 17. Cost Efficiency Matrix - ROI by Model and Sentiment
**File**: `17_cost_efficiency_matrix.png`
**Description**: Heatmap showing return on investment (performance per dollar) for each model-sentiment combination. Green cells indicate better cost efficiency, red cells indicate poorer efficiency.

## Performance Comparison Visualizations

### 4. Multi-dimensional Performance Radar Charts
**File**: `04_performance_radar_charts.png`
**Description**: Four radar charts showing the performance profile of each model across four key metrics. Larger areas indicate better overall performance. All metrics are normalized to 0-1 scale for comparison.

### 5. Latency vs Quality Trade-off Analysis
**File**: `05_latency_vs_quality.png`
**Description**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between response time and translation quality. Points closer to the bottom-right represent optimal performance (low latency, high quality). The efficiency frontier line shows the best possible trade-offs.

### 11. Throughput Analysis - Token Processing Speed
**File**: `11_throughput_analysis.png`
**Description**: Bar chart showing how many tokens each model processes per second. Higher throughput indicates better scalability and faster response times.

### 15. Scalability Analysis - Cost and Time Projections
**File**: `15_scalability_projections.png`
**Description**: Dual-plot showing how total costs scale with volume for each model (top) and processing time requirements assuming 10 parallel requests (bottom). This helps with capacity planning and budget forecasting.

## Quality Analysis Visualizations

### 6. BLEU F1 Score Distribution by Model
**File**: `06_bleu_score_distribution.png`
**Description**: Violin plots showing the complete distribution of BLEU scores for each model. Wider sections indicate more common score ranges, while the box plot shows quartiles.

### 7. Semantic Similarity Heatmap by Model and Sentiment
**File**: `07_semantic_similarity_heatmap.png`
**Description**: Heatmap showing how well each model preserves semantic meaning across different sentiment categories. Green indicates better semantic preservation, red indicates poorer preservation.

### 8. Translation Quality by Sentiment Category
**File**: `08_quality_by_sentiment.png`
**Description**: Four box plots showing how translation quality varies across different sentiment categories. This helps identify if certain sentiment types are more challenging to translate accurately.

### 14. Quality Degradation Pattern Analysis
**File**: `14_quality_degradation_patterns.png`
**Description**: Left plot shows how translation quality changes with sentiment intensity (excellent to very negative). Right plot shows the relationship between text length and translation quality. These patterns help identify when models struggle most.

## Operational Metrics Visualizations

### 9. Model Consistency Analysis
**File**: `09_model_consistency.png`
**Description**: Bar chart showing the coefficient of variation (std/mean) for each model across different metrics. Lower values indicate more consistent performance. Higher values suggest more variability.

### 12. Language-Specific Performance Comparison
**File**: `12_language_specific_performance.png`
**Description**: Four grouped bar charts comparing how each model performs when translating to Russian vs Hebrew. This helps identify if certain models have language-specific strengths or weaknesses.

### 13. Error Rate Analysis
**File**: `13_error_rate_analysis.png`
**Description**: Stacked bar chart showing the percentage of translations that fall below quality thresholds. Lower bars indicate better reliability and fewer quality issues. Thresholds: Correctness/Sentiment < 8, BLEU F1 < 0.9, Semantic Similarity < 0.8.

### 16. Resource Utilization Pattern Analysis
**File**: `16_resource_utilization_patterns.png`
**Description**: Four-panel analysis showing: token efficiency (input vs output), word count ratio distribution, cost efficiency per quality point, and relationship between token count and processing latency.

## Comprehensive Analysis Visualizations

### 18. Performance Metrics Correlation Matrix
**File**: `18_correlation_matrix.png`
**Description**: Correlation matrix showing relationships between all measured variables. Strong positive correlations (red) indicate variables that increase together. Strong negative correlations (blue) indicate variables that move in opposite directions.

### 19. Model Ranking Dashboard
**File**: `19_model_ranking_dashboard.png`
**Description**: Six-panel dashboard showing how each model ranks across key performance criteria. Rankings are shown both in bar order and with numbered badges on each bar.

### 20. Overall Model Performance Assessment
**File**: `20_overall_model_scorecard.png`
**Description**: Left plot shows overall weighted ranking combining all performance criteria. Right plot shows detailed scorecard with individual rankings across all metrics. Green scores indicate top performers, yellow indicates middle tier, red indicates areas for improvement.

## Key Insights from Visualizations

### Cost Analysis Insights
- Meta Llama Maverick 17B offers the best cost efficiency at $0.000331 per translation
- Nova Lite is 2.2x more expensive than the cheapest option without proportional quality benefits
- Cost differences become significant at scale (>$40 difference per 100k translations)

### Quality Analysis Insights
- Meta Llama and Claude 3.5 Haiku deliver nearly identical quality (0.906 vs 0.904 composite scores)
- All models excel at BLEU F1 scores (>0.91), indicating strong translation accuracy
- Quality degradation across sentiment categories is minimal (4.2% from best to worst)

### Performance Analysis Insights
- Nova Micra is 2.7x faster than Claude 3.5 Haiku (1.80s vs 4.77s latency)
- Throughput varies significantly: 224.4 tokens/sec (Nova Micra) to 89.2 tokens/sec (Claude 3.5 Haiku)
